<br />

if you want run it automatic change your name that enable UsePy and run 'autoname.py' on background(python autoname.py)<br />
You need install python moudle 'Flask' and 'keyboard' that could run this script.(pip -i install requirement.txt)<br />
or you need press 'page down' key manually<br />
<br />
I suggested you set your Steam profile name invisible (you can paste the invisible string from file "Blankinvisible name #1.txt" )<br />
then when randomname changed no one could find you changed name<br />
